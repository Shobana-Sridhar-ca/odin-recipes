        <h3> Spicy Cauliflower Shawarma </h3>
        <p>If you like the robust flavors of shawarma, but want to pack extra vegetables into your diet this vegetarian Cauliflower Shawarma is for you. 
            First, I season the cauliflower with a shawarma spice blend of cumin, turmeric, coriander, garlic, paprika and more, then I it roast until it’s caramelized, 
            slightly charred, super flavorful, and incredibly tender. 
        </p>
        <p>While the cauliflower roasts in the oven, I whip up a batch of 3 ingredient Mediterranean Salad (or just slice up some tomatoes and cucumbers) 
            and Tahini sauce to drizzle over the top. Both the salad and the sauce only take minutes to come together.
 
        </p>
        <h3> Ingredients </h3>
        <h4> For The Cauliflower Shawarma </h4>
        <ul>
            <li> 1 large head cauliflower, divided into florets </li>
            <li> 1 large yellow onion, halved and sliced </li>
            <li> 2 tablespoons shawarma spice blend </li>
            <li> Kosher salt </li>
            <li> Ground black pepper </li>
            <li> Extra virgin olive oil</li>
        </ul>
        <h4> To Serve </h4>
        <ul>
            <li> Pita bread, homemade or store bought </li>
            <li> 3-Ingredient Mediterranean Salad </li>
            <li> Tahini sauce </li>
            <li> 1 red onion, halved and thinly sliced, or pickled red onion </li>
            <li> Cucumber pickles, homemade or store bought (optional) </li>
          
        </ul>
        <h3> Instructions </h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>ready:</strong>  Preheat your oven to anywhere between 450°F.</li>
            <li><strong>the vegetables:</strong> </li> Place the cauliflower and onions in a large bowl and toss with the shawarma spice blend 
            and a large pinch of kosher salt and black pepper. Drizzle with 2 to 3 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil and toss to make sure florets are coated.
            <li><strong>Roast the vegetables:</strong></li>  Spread the seasoned cauliflower and onions in a single layer on a large sheet pan. 
            Cover the sheet pan with a large piece of foil. Bake, covered, on the center rack of your oven for about 15 minutes.
            <li><strong>Caramelize the vegetables:</strong></li> Carefully remove the foil and allow the cauliflower to roast for another 25 to 30 minutes or so. 
            Check occasionally to rotate the baking sheet and turn the cauliflower over using a pair of tongs. (Cauliflower should be very tender and caramelized 
            or even charred in some parts).
            <li><strong> the salad and tahini sauce: </strong></li>  While the cauliflower is roasting, make the salad and tahini sauce.
            <li><strong>Serve: </strong> Pile the roasted shawarma cauliflower on a pita and add a couple spoons of the salad, a few slices of sliced or pickled 
                red onion, cucumber pickles (if using) and a drizzle of Tahini Sauce. Wrap the pita up and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
